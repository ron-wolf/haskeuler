# Project Euler in Haskell
Hello there, surfer of the interwebs! This is a log of my progress learning the programming language Haskell by solving the theoretical programming challenges found on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). Iâ€™m still working on making my code more legible and efficient, the latter of which is not Haskellâ€™s _greatest_ strength, though itâ€™s quite efficient for its level of abstraction (praise be to Simon Peyton Jones & Jan-Willem Maessen et al.).

Have fun reading! ðŸ˜Š
