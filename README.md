# Project Euler in Haskell
Hello there, surfer of the interwebs! This is a log of my progress learning the programming language Haskell by solving the theoretical programming challenges found on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). Iâ€™m still working on making my code more legible and efficient, the latter of which is not Haskellâ€™s _greatest_ strength, though itâ€™s quite efficient for its level of abstraction (praise be to Simon Peyton Jones & Jan-Willem Maessen et al.).

Have fun reading! ðŸ˜Š

## Goals

### Major
- Get comfortable with standard library. Pretty much the first step when learning any language.
- Get used to Hindleyâ€“Milner type system, especially constrained type hierarchy (which is about as contrived as the object hierarchy in OO languages, IMO).
- Try to avoid the accumulator pattern, at least where I donâ€™t specifically need it for tail recursion. Having two versions of every function makes code much less readable, and I donâ€™t really feel like using a `where` clause to inline a multi-line function definition.

### Minor
- Move utility functions to external modules. Iâ€™ve begun reusing certain functions throughout Project Euler, so this would reduce duplications and make code more readable (if spread out).
- Remove commented sections. I started work on some pretty cool functions before realizing I didnâ€™t actually need them for the task at hand. However, Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™d be useful for _some_ use cases, and I couldnâ€™t find anything similar on [Hoogle](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/). These will remain available in the commit log.
